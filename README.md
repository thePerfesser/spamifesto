Spamifesto Website

As it stands on April 6th this so-called Spamifesto website is but a fluttering glimpse of what it someday could be. The product of an intoxicated brain and an electronic being, it falls between the lands of fabulous code and "wtf happened here?". As rightly it should, being a #spamart wonder and all. Someday it will be given wings but us lovely spam artists, as we nurse it to a place of beauty and real functionality. Long story short, it's some AI gibberish combined with some perfesserings nonsense that has resulted in a single pager side with a randome spamart background (pulled from objkt.com api) and a content pane for the manifesto. ChatGPT had some fun with a glitchy pink border I quite enjoy. Let's see where the ride takes us. 

LONG LIVE #SPAMART!
