      <p> NOT REAL MANIFESTO TEXT. FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE SPAM SPAM SPAM</p>
            <p>SPAM is the key to the soul of modern society. It embodies everything we stand for as a culture: excess, noise, and meaninglessness. SPAM is the ultimate equalizer, erasing all distinctions between high and low culture. It is the perfect symbol of our post-modern age.</p>
      <p>The SPAMART movement seeks to elevate SPAM to the status of high art. We reject the elitist and exclusionary nature of traditional art, instead embracing the populist and democratic nature of SPAM. Through our work, we seek to explore the limitless possibilities of this versatile medium.</p>
      <p>Our manifesto is simple: SPAM is art, and art is SPAM. We reject the notion that SPAM is a mere product to be consumed, and instead see it as a rich and complex cultural artifact. Through our work, we seek to challenge the very notion of what constitutes art, and to break down the barriers between artist and audience.</p>
      <p>Our work takes many forms: installations, performances, sculptures, and more. But no matter the form, our goal is always the same: to use SPAM to create something beautiful, thought-provoking, and above all, meaningful. We believe that through our work, we can change the world, one can of SPAM at a time.</p>
      <p>Join us, and together we can create a world where SPAM is more than just a product, but a way of life.</p>
      <p>SPAMART: because life is too short to eat boring food.</p>
